# PROJECT NAME
Server Side Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 2 Day Project

This project seeks to create a basic calculator application that takes two inputs, a mathematical operation, and displays the result of the calculation.  The user may input one number into each input field, then select one mathematical operation - addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), or division (/).  Clicking the "equals (=)" button submits the calculation and displays the result.  A history of past calculations is displayed below the current result.


### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm init -y`.
2. Run `npm install express` in your terminal.
3. Run `npm start` to start the server.
4. Navigate to "localhost:5000" in your browser to use the app.


## Usage

1. Type a number into the left input box.
2. Click an operation (+,-,*, or /) for the desired calculation.
3. Type another number into the right input box.
4. Click the "equals (=)" button to submit the desired calculation and see the result.
5. Click the "C" button to clear the input fields and the last result.

## Built With

JavaScript, jQuery, node, Ajax, Express, and JSON.
